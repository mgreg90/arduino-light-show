## Introduction

This is my first attempt at building a cool LED light show based off of an
Arduino Uno and 16ft of LEDs (150 pixels). I'll update this README as I go.

This project relies heavily on [FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED).

This project was also started and inspired by [Project Tempos](https://www.temposlighting.com/guides/how-to-add-custom-leds-to-any-project).

## Libraries

### Colors

A library of functions for setting LEDs to specific colors. Not ready for use.

## Projects

### Lights Off

Simple Project for turning off all lights. Hardcoded to 150 pixels at the
moment.

### Rainbow

Code taken directly from [Project Tempos](https://www.temposlighting.com/guides/how-to-add-custom-leds-to-any-project). All credit to them.
